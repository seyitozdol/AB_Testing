 **************************
## Business Problem:
"Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type named "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" method.
 One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand
 whether average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. The A/B test has been ongoing for a month, and now bombabomba.com
 expects you to analyze the results of this test. For Bombabomba.com, the ultimate success metric is Purchase.
 Therefore, statistical tests should focus on the Purchase metric."

## Dataset Story:
 This dataset contains information about a company's website, including details like the number of ads users have seen and clicked on,
 as well as revenue generated from these actions. There are two separate datasets for the Control and Test groups.
 These datasets can be found on separate sheets of the 'ab_testing.xlsx' Excel file. The Control group was subjected to Maximum Bidding,
 while the Test group was introduced to Average Bidding
